# GraphVizJ #
I like to use dot to create diagrams of all sorts. But GraphViz was really 
getting on my nerves. It is a very basic program. So I decided to write my
own tool in Java. It is based on GraphViz because that is what I was getting
used to, but with all the things that were irritating me improved, replaced or
enhanced.

It is a work in progress, but already I quite enjoy using it because it is quick
and does exactly what I want and expect (most of the time).
